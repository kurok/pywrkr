"""WebSocket benchmarking: ``ws://`` and ``wss://`` targets.

A request/response benchmarker cannot see what matters about a WebSocket
service. The interesting load characteristics are a connection storm (a
thousand sockets opening at once), the number of sockets a server can hold
open, and how long a message takes to come back on a socket that is already
established — none of which is a request rate.

So the shape of the run is different: sockets are long-lived, opened once and
held for the duration, and the work happens *on* them. What is deliberately not
different is everything downstream. WebSocket runs produce an ordinary
:class:`~pywrkr.config.WorkerStats`, so percentiles, ``--threshold``, the exit
code contract, ``--json``, the HTML report, ``pywrkr compare`` and the
OTel/Prometheus exporters all work without knowing this module exists.

Two mappings make that work, and both are stated in the results file rather
than left for the reader to infer (see ``websocket.latency_metric`` and
``websocket.primary_metric``):

* **Latency** is the message round-trip time when ``--ws-expect-reply`` is set,
  and the handshake time otherwise. That is the number a ``p95 < 100ms``
  threshold is about in each case.
* **A "request"** is a message sent when there are messages to send, and a
  completed handshake otherwise — so ``requests_per_sec`` is message
  throughput for a messaging run and connection throughput for a
  connection-storm run.
