"""CI summaries: turn a results file into a job summary or PR comment.

The GitHub Action needs three things from a finished run — a markdown table, a
verdict, and a handful of machine-readable outputs. Doing that in inline YAML
bash would put the part most likely to be wrong in the part hardest to test, so
it lives here and the action just calls ``pywrkr summary``.

Thresholds are re-evaluated from the results file rather than re-run, using the
same metric vocabulary :mod:`pywrkr.compare` uses, so a summary and a gate can
never disagree about what ``p95`` means.
